# AETC Form 341 Builder

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c28d7688-97a0-4ca4-9802-e1247d9ddd68/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aetc-form-341/deploys)

This is a web application that allows a user to input their information required to fill out the AETC (Air Education and Training Command) Form 341 and print it out.

**Now with an option for MTL name and transition phase**

Normally, one would print out a blank PDF of this form, which is entirely locked down, and fill it out by hand, however, **with this site you can digitally fill it out and print it** straight from your browser.

Check it out at https://aetc-form-341.netlify.app or at https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ChrisBrownie55/aetc-form-341
